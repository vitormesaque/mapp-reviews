# Temporal dynamics of Requirements Engineering from mobile app reviews

MAPP-Reviews (Monitoring App Reviews) is a software, which (i) extracts requirements with negative evaluation from app reviews, (ii) generates time series based on the frequency of negative evaluation, and (iii) trains predictive models to identify requirements with higher trends of negative evaluation.

In MAPP-Reviews, we aim to detect the negative reviews of a software requirement that are starting to happen and make a forecast to see if they will become serious in the subsequent periods, i.e., high frequency in negative reviews.
