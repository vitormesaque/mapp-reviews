            "08/03/19 - Doesnt deliver to me.Would make more sense if you delivered to areas outside of bigger cities...We need the service more than those with access to more choices in food.Im starving,would tip very well for some friggin Moe's.\n",

            "01/01/19 - Their services are declining and degrading to the extent that they now have started charging for cancelled food which noone has received nor had eaten. The reason of cancellation was extended time for delivery from your side.\n",
            "05/30/19 - Received delivery after 2 hours of order. Food got spoiled and soar because of delay. No option to contact customer care even after more than one hour delay. No option to cancel order even after 1.5 hour delay\n",

            "09/09/19 - The delivery guy cancelled the order and blamed others that his mobile was on charges and some one misused. After few minutes i got a notification showing order delivered. Worst food order experience. Swiggy and Zomato riders are far better.\n",
            "09/19/19 - I'd leave zero stars if I could. They change your order without notifying you and food is always missing but overcharge still. The place you order from won't help because they say it's down to Uber Eats. Avoid at all costs!\n",

            "01/03/19 - worst.. bad quality of food that offers exciting discount... also they impose unreasonable charge for cancelled food order stating delay in cancellation which again is because of their long IVR queue and useless process time.. equally disgusting support team as well.\n",

            "11/12/19 - Use another delivery service. When a driver fails or won't deliver your food. The driver keeps the food and you have no recourse for the time spent waiting nor any avenue to rate the driver.\n",
            "09/21/19 - Awful experience. Driver made several stops before ours which would explain why it was cold. Deliverer also claimed to be on a bike but infact arrived in a car. Delivery was over an hour after ordered.\n",

            "04/13/19 - I ordered food from Uber Eats ....Primata Burger Sao paulo. Food arrived cold and incorrect to my request. I tried to complain but no response. Its better for you to go to the restaurant yourself ..Uber eats consistently delivers food of poor quality\n",
            "10/27/19 - Food is consistently late. Past few orders, delivery drivers have picked up wrong orders delaying our order. Tried to give them benefit of the doubt but every other food delivery service works better eg Deliveroo, Menulog.\n",

            "12/07/19 - They let their drivers park down the street, not knock on the door, call you can hang up and pretend they tried to deliver your food so they can keep your 80 dollar order for themselves. Thanks James.\n",
            "04/09/19 - Their habit of rating the customers and closing their accounts is not fair . If this continues they will lose their customers in this competitive world There are so many food delivery apps other than Uber Eats like Swiggy Zomato Food panda and so many.\n",

            "10/10/18 - It is the worst of all online food apps I've ordered first time and it took 40 mins just to say that we can't deliver this dish and to order something else What the hell is with uber eats at least they should have informed in the beginning\n",
